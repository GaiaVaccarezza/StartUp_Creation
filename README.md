During the course of Business Analytics of my Master of Science three collegues of mine and I had to come up with an idea of a Start-Up and do a research to understand if it was a valuable idea. 

Our proposal was a social network for blood donators or potential blood donator. The aim was create a platform where curious people, especially the young ones, 
could ask questions or ask for help to start donating blood to volunteers or donors. Moreover, this web site should remind donors to continue donating. 
The idea for our project started with an empirical observation: every time we went donating blood, we saw posters on the walls aimed at
encouraging young people to do the same. As these initiatives explain, the reason why the associations focus so much on young people
is that, of all possible donors, young people (18-35) are the proportionally least likely to donate (in 2019 they represented 29,7% of donors). Since we knew that the number of
donors is too small for the necessities of blood from patients and hospitals, we decided to try and solve this issue by encouraging as many young people as possible to become donors.

The first thing we did was to wonder: why is that so? Based on our past experience, two possible reasons came to mind. 
Firstly, fear and disinformation. Secondly, we did not believe that people are apathetic or selfish, but rather that they never
received a stimulus to start donating. Therefore, it might be important to nudge them. 
To combine these two problems with a unique solution we decided that we needed a unique 
tool, and so we chose to propose an application. This is how “Blooder” was born.

The analysis starts with the creation of a survey on Qualtrics to has people why they do/do not donate and what could help them start/continue to donate. 
The survery was answered by around 1000 people. The data obtained was then used to test our hypothesis. Based on the results we decided to focus more on some features of the Social Network with respect to others. 

In detail, the analysis of the data collected showed sufficient interest in the proposed idea. The
interest is particularly relevant among the group of potential donors who are held back by
feelings of fear towards the donation of bloood and would be willing to use "Blooder".
